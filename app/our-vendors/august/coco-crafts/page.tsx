            <p>Hello! I am Cory, the creator behind Coco Crafts. My sewing journey began quite suddenly in the spring of 2020. At the start of the pandemic I made face masks for my family.  Friends started asking for them, and before I knew it, orders were pouring in and I had a small business in the works!  I have always been creative and exploring different crafts so when the need for masks started to slow down, I decided to try sewing pouches. That quickly inspired me to learn new skills and start making totes, crossbody, and handbags. I love going through the creative process with my customers. Helping them to design a custom bag that becomes an expression of who they are through style, color, and features is a huge part of my success. I source the fabric, faux leather and vinyl interfacings and hardware myself. Then I cut, iron, sew, zip, pinch, punch and rivet it into a beautiful bag or the like.  Custom orders are my favorite because I am able to make something my customer will love.</p>
            <p>Selling at handmade markets around the northwest has been an exhilarating experience over the last 3 years. Being able to show off my creativity and craftsmanship inspires me to keep making what my customers love. Itâ€™s always fun to see repeat customers who are thrilled to see me at the same market year after year.</p>
