I now make necklaces, too, and have even made wood bead garland decorations for Christmas.  Still, my primary focus is beaded gemstone and crystal bracelets.  I love learning about the meanings and qualities of each stone I use in my creations, and I find the creation process very calming and fulfilling.</p></div>
